# Battery Level Indicator (ELP101)

## 📘 Course Information
- **Course:** ELP101 – Engineering Laboratory / Electronics Project  
- **Year:** First Year Undergraduate  
- **Project Title:** Battery Level Indicator  

## 🧠 Project Overview
This project involves the design and implementation of a **Battery Level Indicator circuit** using the **LM3914 integrated circuit**.  
The circuit visually displays the battery voltage level using a series of LEDs, where the number of glowing LEDs represents the battery charge level.

This project introduces fundamental concepts of:
- Analog electronics  
- Integrated circuits  
- Voltage measurement  
- LED-based visual indication  

## 🎯 Aim
To design and build a battery level indicator using an integrated circuit that displays battery voltage levels through LEDs.

## 🧪 Components Used
- LM3914 IC  
- 10 × LEDs  
- DC Power Source (Battery)  
- Potentiometer (10kΩ)  
- Resistors (18kΩ, 4.7kΩ, 56kΩ)  
- Connecting wires  
- Breadboard  

## ⚙️ Working Principle
The LM3914 IC compares the input battery voltage with internally set reference voltages.  
Based on the input voltage level, the IC drives the corresponding LEDs in sequence. As the battery voltage increases, more LEDs glow, providing a clear visual indication of the battery level.

A potentiometer is used to adjust the voltage range and sensitivity of the indicator.

## 📊 Observations
- LEDs glow sequentially as the input voltage increases  
- The LED display shows a near-linear relationship with battery voltage  
- The circuit operates reliably within the designed voltage range  

## ✅ Conclusion
The battery level indicator circuit successfully demonstrates an effective method to monitor battery voltage using the LM3914 IC.  
It provides a simple, clear, and practical visual indication of battery charge levels and serves as a strong introduction to IC-based circuit design.
